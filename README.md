# Logo Quiz - Setup Instructions

## How to Add Logo Images

The quiz is looking for 15 logo images. You need to extract the logos from your PDF and save them in the `images` folder.

### Option 1: Manual Screenshot Method (Easiest)

1. Open `LogoQuiz.pdf` in Preview or Adobe Acrobat
2. For each logo page (pages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30):
   - Take a screenshot of just the logo image
   - Save it in the `images` folder with the corresponding name:
     - Logo 1 (Michelin) → `logo1.png`
     - Logo 2 (Paramount) → `logo2.png`
     - Logo 3 (Tic Tac) → `logo3.png`
     - Logo 4 (FILA) → `logo4.png`
     - Logo 5 (MINI) → `logo5.png`
     - Logo 6 (KFC) → `logo6.png`
     - Logo 7 (Sony Ericsson) → `logo7.png`
     - Logo 8 (National Geographic) → `logo8.png`
     - Logo 9 (Heinz) → `logo9.png`
     - Logo 10 (Cartoon Network) → `logo10.png`
     - Logo 11 (BIC) → `logo11.png`
     - Logo 12 (Dunkin' Donuts) → `logo12.png`
     - Logo 13 (Wikipedia) → `logo13.png`
     - Logo 14 (Del Monte) → `logo14.png`
     - Logo 15 (Campbell's) → `logo15.png`

### Option 2: Use Online Images

Alternatively, you can download logo images from the internet:
1. Search for "[Brand Name] logo png" on Google Images
2. Download high-quality transparent PNG versions
3. Save them in the `images` folder with the correct filenames

### Supported Image Formats

The quiz supports: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`

Just make sure the filenames match exactly: `logo1.png`, `logo2.png`, etc.
